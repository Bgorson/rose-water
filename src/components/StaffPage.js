    description2: `My therapeutic approach draws primarily from psychodynamic and relational-cultural theory while also incorporating client-centered and humanistic perspectives. I believe that relationships can be a mechanism for change, and that this starts with the therapeutic relationship. I strive to create a safe, trusting, and collaborative relationship with clients to support them in processing how their past experiences shape who they are and how they interact with others. My therapeutic style is warm, curious, and non-judgmental. I meet clients where they are in their process and tailor my work with each client to address their goals, needs, and unique identities.`,
    description3: `In my free time, I love to cook, run by the lake, try new restaurants, travel, read, and spend time with family and friends.`,
